DataTables Sample Project
This sample project demonstrates the basic structure required to connect an HTML tableâ€™s data feed to a JS server-side script.

The jQuery DataTables plug-in is used to enhance the table and populate its contents with fake data from an online REST API. As a result, the HTML table becomes responsive, interactive, and linked to the server.
